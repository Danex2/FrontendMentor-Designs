## Ping landing page project

### Landing page notes

Overall difficulty: This was pretty beginner / junior. I did not have much trouble putting things together besides a few spacing / responsiveness stuff.

What I could have done better: I definitely should have worked from mobile -> desktop, I feel it would have been much easier to scale up than work backwards for responsiveness. I also feel like my HTML is garbage but I'm not really sure what tags to use if it's a landing page, probably just divs.
